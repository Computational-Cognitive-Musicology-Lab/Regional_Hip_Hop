Make No Sense
Youngboy Never Broke Again

I could hit it, I could whip it, I could bag it, I could stash it
I could trap out like a motherfucker
And you know me, bitch, I just bought another 30 burner
I whip too hard, so I got Ike and Meech, got Tina Turner
It don't make sense, I'm not alright, bitch, I'll put you under
I ain't cut too much, I got that shit that make 'em tweak like damn
Can't be in front the trap too much, the world know who I am
This shit ain't sweet, who close to me, I see 'em hatin' like damn
All I know get the money, still gon' be the one to slay 'em
Like nigga, uh, nigga
Nigga, bitch, nigga, baow, with my jewelry
