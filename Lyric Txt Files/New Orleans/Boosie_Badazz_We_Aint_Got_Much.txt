When I was young my favorite movie was Menace
Cousin' go to sleep, I'd be takin' off his tennis
Fuckin' with the hood girls at the pool swimmin'
When I was half swaggin', when I had no rhythm
It's the hood, I was born, every night we had suppers
Gamble 'til the sun come, I guess we all hustlers
Everybody had a flame, mane, we all had crushes
Happy if we had mayonaisse, never had mustard
Walked to the movies, stop and eat, Louie's
Steal a couple bicycles 'fore I make it home
Can't let mama see the bikes, so I park 'em 'round the corn'
Diggin' all the gangsters who was ballin' on the corner
Know they gon' pop it off 'cause our fuckin' block rolled
Daytons and Vogues and Keith Sweat on the speakers
Back then we ain't even listen to the fuckin' teachers
Mad, mom the only one up in the bleachers, where's dad?
Still, we was grateful for the times we never had
I say a prayer every night that my cousin' hit up on the dice
And get him some cash
