Webbie

If you think I just lucked up you got me so fucked up
Left dem niggas lone yeah I did it so what
I ain't finna let them niggas get me fucked up
I'm right here I ain't got nowhere to fuckin go
Hittin nigga for the low gimme fifty for the show
Got a pound full of blow I could drown in the mo
Rosé by by the case mo drink then the sto
Ho ice cold like she live in the snow

Smoke mo weed then a mufucka grow
Gotta car no keys once I get in there go

Wet wet paint yeah the mufucka glow
Catchin every slang that the mufucka throw

There ain't nuthin in the world I'm fearin
And I'm so serious
Outta my bidness these niggas so curious
