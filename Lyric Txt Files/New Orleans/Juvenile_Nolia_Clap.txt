I’m in the Calio, You know I’m headed front of town
By Kayotic and Lil real One, cuz it’s going down
You see the DB’s tell ‘em Wacko lookin for ‘em
I got some dro, I got some change, I got some pussy for ‘em
If they ask you where I’m at I’m in the Melph pickin up Chuck
In the chromed out Bubblegum Pickup Truck
Slide on Josephine, Holla at Lil Kia and Pluck
My nigga Troy told me to keep it real as fuck
We bought the House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington & Frerret, across the street from Babosca
But first I’m bout to snatch up all Saratoga
Head straight to Foot Action and snatch me two pair of Solja’s
Take a left on Taladonna get a O of that doja
Tell ‘em right on my trail and hit the gars and lets roll up
I’m bout to hit Julio and get the blazes from soda
I got Geezy waiting on VL we bout to bang up this Yola
