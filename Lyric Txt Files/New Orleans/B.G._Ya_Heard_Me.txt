Ya Heard Me
B.G.

It's like B. Gizzle, the world wide ghetto pass
I'm reppin nigga, take a flight to the motherland
I fear God only, never fear another man
It's never one hustle, I always got a backup plan
It ain't no secret I can tell ya bout the gutta man
I'm a write a book on how to come out the struggle man
Now come through, you know what's in them dufflebags
A lot of gats, a lot of cash, and some ski masks
You know my street pass, it been certified
Stop lying I'm a g you been heard about
Stop repping, you a pussy I been heard of you
You playin with a gangsta homie the nerve of you
Oh you lookin for me, but the homie lookin for you
Have yo people wearing a rest in peace shirt of you
My reputation on the block been A-1
I'm the same N.O. nigga I been since day
