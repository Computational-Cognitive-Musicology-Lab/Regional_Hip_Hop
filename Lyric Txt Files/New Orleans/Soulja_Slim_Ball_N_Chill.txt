It's like this year the first drought season this year
Crackheads can't find no good cook so they rehabbin' and drinkin' beer
It's around election time, so it's slow - no drug traffickin'
Connects scared to move weight and hustlers don't score 'cause niggas taxin'
30 for a bird, 17 for a half a bird
I got o-z's for a g, holla at me and you'll get served
Proper I got it powdered and I got it rocked up
Let me know when you comin' 'cause I'm gon' have my 40 Glock up
For protection, I'm beefin' with some niggas from my own section
Hatin' situation, heard I got a killer connection
Shit has to be flexin' too much in my '99 Yukon
Gave it away, bought me a 600 Benz and a Lexus two tone
GS400,Â snatchin' niggas and shit - I done it
So I'ma be up on mines, I got that feelin' you comin'
You think I'ma stop my shine 'cause you niggas hatin' on mine?
Coward niggas do that, I'm real - respect my mind
I got all my workers runnin', sellin' the ?????? 20's for slabs
Fire beige coke in the 6th street court and on the ave
Shit so dry Tonto and Wop ain't even got nothin'
Them niggas usually have somethin' when it's a drought season - ass out season
So me and my souljas we got the projects sewed up
Make it fire when it's uncut with a lil' soda
Solid ass boulder, that's what you get
I done double doubled my money off this one half a brick - quick
