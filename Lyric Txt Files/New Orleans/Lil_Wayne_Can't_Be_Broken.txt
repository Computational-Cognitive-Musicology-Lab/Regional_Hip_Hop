They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce
In 1982, my momma take me to a space shuttle
Say now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw
Twisted like tornados too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down and I can't hit the brakes for you
