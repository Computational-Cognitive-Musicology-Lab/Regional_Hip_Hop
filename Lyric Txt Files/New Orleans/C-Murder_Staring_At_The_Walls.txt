Staring At The Walls
C-Murder

Hard living out of jail, my people say I'm finished
They said I'm bad news, like my big cousin Jimmy
My name's in the paper, cause I'm always in messes
The po-po's caught me hot with some guns and a vest
But I'd rather get caught with it, then without it
You run up on No Limit, you better be 'bout it
I'll never tuck my tank in, I'm never running
I don't care if it's me against a motherfucking hundred
I represent the tank, that means I'm a soldier
I wear No Limit Gear with MP's and smoke doulja
There goes the police sweatin' me again
I had some open warrants so the fools took me in
