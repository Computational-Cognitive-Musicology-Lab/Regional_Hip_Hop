Ball N Chill 2
Soulja Slim

GS four hundred,Â snatchin' niggas and shit I done it
So I'ma be up on mines, I got that feelin' you comin'
You think I'ma stop my shine 'cause you niggas hatin' on mine?
Coward niggas do that, I'm real respect my mind
I got all my workers runnin', sellin' the white twenties for slabs
Fire beige coke in the 6th street court and on the ave
Shit so dry Tonto and Wop ain't even got nothin'
Them niggas usually have somethin' when it's a drought season ass out season
So me and my souljas we got the projects sewed up
Make it fire when it's uncut with a lil' soda
Solid ass boulder, that's what you get
I done double doubled my money off this one half a brick quick
