Blue Face Hunnids
Snoop Dogg

Stepped in the game straight crippin'
New whip, wood grain dippin'
Told all my homies, "Don't go so hard"
But my East side niggas won't listen
Roll around town with your bitch, lil' nigga
One hand on her ass, one finger on the trigger
Catch a nigga slipping if you wannna start shit
Roll checks on your motherfucking carpet
Try and run, nigga, but you too slow 
Two shots hitting, yelling, "Too old" 
One nigga down, got two to go 
Spraying with the K and hit two in a row 
Bang-bang, bang on 'em 
Lil' homie in the back with the thang on him
Long Beach certified blue chip
Eastside nigga bang and rolling
Twenty crip
