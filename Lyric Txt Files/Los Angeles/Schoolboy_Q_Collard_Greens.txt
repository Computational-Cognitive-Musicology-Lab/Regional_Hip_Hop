Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah, I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face, frenchy, freaking, swapping tongue
Click my link and spread your buns, lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it baby, no Saddam 
(icky, icky, icky, uh)
Fucking in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, probably off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo
