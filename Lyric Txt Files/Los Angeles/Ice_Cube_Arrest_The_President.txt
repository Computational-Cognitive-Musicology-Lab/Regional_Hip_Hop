Get smart 'fore the shit start
'Fore it get dark, 'fore they hit you with a pitchfork
Better crip walk, this is real talk
Smoke Kush and push then we peel off
Niggas still rollin' with the wheels off
Always lookin' out for the crisscross
I'm a bigger boss than Rick Ross
Always winnin', nigga get lost
It's the warlord, bring the voodoo
When I bail through it's crazy like Bellevue
What they tell you? Leave that boy alone
Like Home Alone, fuck the Skull & Bones
Arrest the president, you got the evidence
That nigga is Russian intelligence
When it rains it pours
Did you know the new white was orange?
Boy, you're showing your horns
They're tryin' to replace my halo with thorns
You so basic with your vape stick
Let's go apeshit in the matrix
