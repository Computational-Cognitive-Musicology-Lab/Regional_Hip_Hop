Shoot a movie in this bitch with extended clips
Bet he feel guilty when I knock down the innocent
Glock with a dick for a Jehovah's if he witnessed it
It's not about how you start, it's 'bout how you finish shit
Shots to the face, no chaser
Fuck a fade, I'm only givin' out tapers
Woke up early just to slide on you later
I always keep a hard pole for a hater
Two dicks, I'm with the full-fledged bullshit
It don't make sense, I can't pay full attention
I always stood out, 'cause I was too ahead to fit in
No pot to piss in, now my gold really pissin'
Blueface bust-down, Aquafina on my pendant
Grown-ass man, baby, I ain't got no dependent
No forensic, no witness, no ballistics
No attachment, but this Glock got extensions
