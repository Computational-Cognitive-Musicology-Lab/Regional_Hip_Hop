In The Dark
Y.G.

I like my bitches dark
I hit 'em at the park when it's dark
I hit my target like a dart
YG go dumb but he smart
In real life you a mark
Disrespect me, I'm on yo head I'm a scarf
Told my barber "Cut my hair, leave a part"
But don't line me up in the dark
My life dark but I see the truth (But I see the truth)
Pop up on your bitch like peek-a-boo (It's a pop up)
I'm in the coupe, I don't need the roof (I don't need the roof)
Her ass really shocked me like Pikachu (Ow)
I do a bitch harsh (Harsh)
Break a heart to thousand parts
They like "How this ghetto nigga on the charts?"
Face down, ass up, back gotta be arched
