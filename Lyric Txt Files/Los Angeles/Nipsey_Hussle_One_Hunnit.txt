One Hunnit
Nipsey Hussle

Ballin' for real, I'm talkin' big money
Hundred thousand a show but that's my rent money
Four thousand a pound but that's my smoke budget
Fuck it off at the mall that's cause these hoes love it
I've been ballin' for a minute
I'ma grind, that's my motto till I get it
Full time, if you follow my commitment
You'll shine nigga, that's a promise man could kill it
Afghanistan in my shoe, dynasty in my vision
Built this shit up from nothin', congratulations you did it
I'm valet with a bitch and we at the Beverly Center
Sunlight hit them VVS Rolex make a prism, glitter
On her face, two C's on her waist
Gold spikes on her heels
Purse match, she for real
Meet basic, famous and naked
Black sacks fifteen, prolly playin' blue laces in the six
Bitches that strip fallin' for the Crip
She want me for my money, I tell her such my rich
Make her fuck the clique
Then I lace my Chucks and split
I'ma RSC for real and I ain't never loved a bitch nigga
Got money but I'm never one to switch
Live life under pressure but I never bust an itch
And real nigga be like "Hussle do your shit"
Hoes ask me if I ever was a pimp
What you think?
