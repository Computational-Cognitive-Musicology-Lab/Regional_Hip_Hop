Rackings on rackings, got backends on backends
I'm ridin' around in a coupe
I take your bitch right from you
Bitch I'm a dog, woof 
Beat the ho walls loose
Hop in the frog, woah
I tell that bitch to come for me
I swear these niggas under me
They hate and the devil keep jumpin' me
Bankrolls on me keep me company
We did the most, yeah
Pull up in Ghosts, yeah
My diamonds a choker
Holdin' the fire with no holster 
Rick The Ruler, diamonds cooler
This a Rollie not a Mueller
Dabbin' on 'em like the usual
Magic with the brick, do voodoo
Court side with a bad bitch
Then I send the bitch through Uber
I'm young and rich and plus I'm boujee
I'm not stupid so I keep the Uzi
Rackings on rackings, got backends on backends
So my money makin' my back ache
You niggas got a low Act' rate
We from the Nawf, yeah dat way
Fat cookie blunt in the ash tray
Two bitches, just national smash day
Hop in the Lamb', have a drag race
I let them birds take a bath bae
