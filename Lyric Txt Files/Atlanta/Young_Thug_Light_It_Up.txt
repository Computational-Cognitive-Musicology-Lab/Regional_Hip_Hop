I just spilled sauce in the Benz
Oh yes, I'ma do it again
I just now turnt up my bitch
And she just been shoppin' and shit
Damn, I can't do nothin' with Jeezy
And I plan on dyin' like this
I had to Balmain my tweezers
Now they just notice I'm lit
Three five seven for my mama 'nem
I was one of the ones with Obama 'nem
I play it safe with my commas now
Y'all niggas worse than your mamas now
Ain't had to go to the pulpit
I got to sit with the government
I got a team up at Popeye's
Even at the airport, we mob ties
