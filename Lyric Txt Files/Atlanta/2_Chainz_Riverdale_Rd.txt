You wasn't there when mama was struggling
You wasn't there when mama was fussing
Told 'em ketchup, you too far in the mustard
I had a Chevelle and wanted a cutlass
I went to work and I made an abundance
Gucci flip flops with the corns and bunions
Counting blue hundreds and smoking an onion
And she got an onion and I wanna rub it
We hanging off the net, see that's where my office at
We dressed all in black
We got 'em calling back, just went to the mall and back
When you was the quarterback, I had them quarter sacks
