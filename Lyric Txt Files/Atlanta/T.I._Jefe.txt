Jefe
T.I.

Let me welcome you, get introduced to the king
Bentleys, Ferraris, brand new and they clean
So disappointed when niggas talk shit on their records, when you see 'em, don't do anything
Okay, killin' these niggas with more than before
Been stuntin' and shinin' since back in the nineties
I'm 'bout it, forgot the Glock in my pocket, remind you and plug the whole city behind me
Spent hundreds of thousands, no millions on diamonds
In Philly, they go ask Meek Milly about me
I'm solid and thorough, stand up as fuck
See these niggas, I just be like, 'What the fuck? '
Ain't no way in hell you can fuck with us
Like a bad bitch with no furniture, I can't do nothin' with her
Still hit her and them bad bitches who hung with her
That's how I do, ay, can't give you the formula
Don't stop me, I'm just warmin' up
Niggas be actin', the fuck they performin' for
Leave 'em right there for the coroner
Man, my bitch look so bad, she a foreigner
Aston Martin, the attire is formal
How we kick it, ain't shit 'bout us normal
We Grand Hustle, schemin' and chasin' our dream, stackin' that paper
Hearin' my raps, you see me, you see what I mean, drippin' that flavor
Fuck niggas hatin', don't try me, I split that potato, then go sit and eat with the mayor
Skiin' in Vail, David Chapelle told me you niggas is funny as hell
Run to the smoke and then runnin' and tell, open the vault, put you under the jail
