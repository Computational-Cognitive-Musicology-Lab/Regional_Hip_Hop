I got that tool when I walk out the door
Got some head in the coupe and let off on her nose
I got some boujee, she holdin' my chopper
I got some boujee, she doin' my chores
I got that boujee, she loadin' my Glock
I got that boujee, she foldin' my clothes

Load some vans, they meet at the dock
Hand on the fire when I'm whippin' the block
Family gon' doe when it comes to the boss
Spray out the fire when you it exhaust
Count some more money, it got me exhausted
I was in the dungeon before takin' off
Stay in the streets and I'm breakin' the law
Hang on the corner, they sellin' da boy
You come with them dollars, you come for the board
Came with a stylist you, missin' the sport
