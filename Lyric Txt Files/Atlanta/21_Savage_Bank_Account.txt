I buy a new car for the bitch
I tear down the mall with the bitch
You can't even talk to the bitch
She fucking with bosses and shit
I pull up in 'Rari's and shit
With choppers and Harley's and shit
I be Gucci'd down
You wearing Lacoste and shit
Yeah, Moncler, yuh, fur came off a bear, yuh
Triple homicide, put me in a chair, yuh
Triple cross the plug, we do not play fair, yuh
Got 'em tennis chains on and they real blingy
Draco make you do the chicken head like Chingy
Walk in Neiman Marcus and I spend a light fifty
Please proceed with caution, shooters, they be right with me
Bad bitch, cute face and some nice titties
