Haile Selassi
Lupe Fiasco

To the limit
The limit in the Methadone clinic
Ridin' with the pack like a Pelitan
Flyin' with the sack in the trap like the pregnant
As it breaks in the backs from the cracks that we step upon
If I triple my worth, will it cripple my mom?
If I simple my search, will it mental my calm?
Will it hurt if I give you my palm?
To tell in it and don't put a nail in it
How you gonna see the world if you wailin'
And readin' my palms like there's braille in it
Is it the trail or the forest?
Or the forest with the trail in it?
That's a sail with a 12 in it
Water coming through from impalin' it
Nothin' left of the boat but my holes
Still I fill up the world and I float, like
