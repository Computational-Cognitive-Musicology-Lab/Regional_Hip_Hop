These bitches love Sosa
And they love them Glo' Boys
Know we from the 'Go boy
But we cannot go boy
No I don't know old boy
I know he's a broke boy
Raris and Rovers
Convertible Lambos boy
You know I got bands boy
And it's in my pants boy
Disrespect them O Boys
You won't speak again boy
Don't think that I'm playing boy
No we don't use hands boy
No we don't do friends boy
Collect bands I'm a land lord
I gets lotsa commas
I can fuck yo mama
I ain't with the drama
You can meet my llama
Riding with three hunna
With three hundred foreigns
These bitches see Chief Sosa
I swear to god they honored
