Neighborhood Hero
Lil Durk

That street shit
We don't reply to niggas with that tweet shit
Beef shit, nigga said fuck me, he don't mean it
Sweet shit, foenem caught a body, they gon' beat it
Defense, Glock to his face, he won't eat it
All facts, nigga snaked me once and I'ma fall back
Nigga say he my brother, but he snaked me, what you call that?
I cheated on my BM three times with my dog ass
She gave her number, I delete it, 'cause they all rats
Chiraq, where the police don't call backup
Last nigga played with Durkio, he in a backwood
Chicago niggas play with PnB, but ain't no matchup
If you know me like you know me, where I'm from, I'm not a rapper
Burglar, scammer, a murderer, I'm handsome
When I'm off the drugs, I swear I'm steady throwin' tantrums
Angelo told me once before, he want a Phantom
I can't say no 'cause that's my son, I gotta answer
