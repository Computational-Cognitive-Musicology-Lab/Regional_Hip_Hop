You Ain't Gang
Lil Bibby

Bitch I'm an OG, but I'm quick to pull it like a youngin'
In my pockets, all hundreds, run up on me, bitch I'm drummin'
I was thuggin' on the corner with my niggas, came from nothin'
Fuck these bitches, I don't trust 'em, I'm a dog, fuck her cousin
They like, "Goddamn Bibby why you still on that block shit?"
Get you shot quick 'round them niggas I don't rock with
I seen niggas turned Christian when they feel that hot shit
Thought you was a savage, now you on that Lord watch shit
Give a fuck if you box well, I got hot shells
Drop Ls, pull up back to back and give your block hell
Pistol whip your kids, I'm a demon, I'm a rot in Hell
Do the time, I will not tell like I'm Vondell
