Pop Out
Polo G

She don't like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands gotta blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it's Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of two K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon' only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten up yo shoe lace
Lil' bro get up close let the Glock twenty two spray
