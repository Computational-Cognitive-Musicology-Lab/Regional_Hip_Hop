Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty I'm really with' it, I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town, might see a bitch and forget I hit it
Lil Bibby on the track with me, one mistake and he clap fifty
When I hit the scene hoes go insane
Cause they know a nigga got them racks with' me,
No velcro but the strap with' me let a nigga wanna act silly
I'm a let it off and then leave him there, ride off and don't even care
Bitch I cash out 'till I pass out, got a couple trues I don't even wear
In the game bitch I do my thang, hoes scream my name I ain't even there
Lil Herb boy I doos this, leave your bitch wetter than a pool pit
And I make bands like I make friends, bought some ray-bans on some cool shit
But now it's back to some killa shit, got some wild hoes that'll drill a bitch
Yea it's no limit, thirty years runnin', thirty years gunnin' and we still the shit
I never run cause I stay to fight, I'll cook a nigga like steak and rice
And it's hella real in the battlefield, gangbang gotta pay the price
Hit a nigga with the forty fifth, bet it make his ass do forty flips
M-O-B I don't love a ho, I'm a be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die, smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man cause I understand how a nigga lie
Never snitch on a nigga dry, yea that's how a nigga die
Got a yellow bitch in the passenger, she gon' suck and fuck if I get her high
If I do the dash then my whip will fly, foriegn shit what a nigga ride
I ain't never sneezin' let a nigga try, got the nine rutger on a nigga side
