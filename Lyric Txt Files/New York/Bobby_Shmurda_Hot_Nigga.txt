I been selling crack since like the fifth grade
Really never made no difference what the shit made
Jaja taught me flip them packs and how to maintain
Get that money back and spend it on the same thang
Shawty like the way that I ball out
I be getting money 'til I fall out
You talking cash, dog, I goes all out
Shorty love the way that I floss out
Free Greezy, though, let all of my dogs out
Mama said no pussycats inside my doghouse
That's what got my daddy locked up in the dog pound
Free Phantom though, let all of my dogs out
We gon' pull up in that hooptie like we cops on 'em
With them 16s, we gon' put some shots on 'em
I send a lil' thot to send the drop on him
She gon' call me up and I'ma sic the hots on him
