A$AP Rocky

I be that pretty motherfucker, Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin', we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this Coke that I imported, just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my click for nothing
Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing
