Look at y'all sharin' one bottle in the club
One bottle full of bub' ass niggas
Look at y'all not havin' game ass niggas
Y'all niggas share a chain ass niggas
Same cup in the hand ass nigga
In the club with a credit card scam ass nigga
No dick in the pants ass nigga
I be damned if I fuck a non-man ass nigga
I will, I will, I will never fuck a non-man ass nigga
I would never lie
Even if that nigga flew me and my bitches all the way out to Dubai
Pussy, you tried, pussy ass nigga you lie
Pussy ass nigga, you high
Bitch I'm me, hundred on the wrist, I ski
Art on the wall, Basqui, fuck who see
Look at you fake dope dealers
Know real niggas that be movin' weight in them villas
Talkin' 'bout ki's, say it's ki's in the van
But he really move grams and he split it with his mans
