A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy, that bugs me
Behind her best friends back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less than a week ago, he's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speaker phone
Right before he cleaned up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You could stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk, never swung on nobody
Never let a gun spark
Big '97 Benz with the old body, pulls up to the corner, out jumps his whole body
