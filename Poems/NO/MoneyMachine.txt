Money Machine 3
Curren$y

Fuck around and get killed for not lettin' me live
Shit around me that real, my niggas is that trill
You was lookin' for a plug, you ain't know
That the man was right here, makin' squares disappear
Magic man, you heard about the legendary three and a quarter length
Furs in February always on point
And it was never ready, I lit my joint and dipped in my Chevy
Fifty seven, all stocks, hardtop, I throw switches on my drop
Shawty said she don't fuck around with that help
She want Spitta 'cause that nigga came in here and made a boss of himself
I came through the set, paint wet, rims gold
Like a championship belt, she fucked up when she let me know how she felt
Say you love me, well, baby girl, do somethin' for me
Turn nothin' into somethin', keep your daddy stuntin'
Bentley blueberry muffins, hopped out like a dragon puffin'
Brung two shooters with me and my baddest woman
