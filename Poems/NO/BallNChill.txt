Ball and Chill
Soulja Slim

It's like this year the first drought season this year
Crackheads can't find no good cook so they rehabbin' and drinkin' beer
It's around election time, so it's slow no drug traffickin'
Connects scared to move weight and hustlers don't score 'cause niggas taxin'
Thirty for a bird, seventeen for a half a bird
I got o z's for a g, holla at me and you'll get served
Proper I got it powdered and I got it rocked up
Let me know when you comin' 'cause I'm gon' have my forty Glock up
For protection, I'm beefin' with some niggas from my own section
Hatin' situation, heard I got a killer connection
Shit has to be flexin' too much in my ninety nine Yukon
Gave it away, bought me a 600 Benz and a Lexus two tone
Gee es four hundred snatching niggas and shit I done it
So I'm a be up on mines I got that feeling you coming
You think I'm a stop my shine cause you niggas hating on mine
Coward niggas do that I'm real respect my mind
I got all my workers running selling the white twenties for slabs
Fire beige coke in the sixth street court and on the ave
Shit so dry Tonto and Wop ain't even got nothin'
Them niggas usually have somethin' when it's a drought season ass out season
So me and my souljas we got the projects sewed up
Make it fire when it's uncut with a lil' soda
Solid ass boulder, that's what you get
I done double doubled my money off this one half a brick quick
