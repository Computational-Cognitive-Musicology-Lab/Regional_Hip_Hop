Up The Smoke
Offset

I'm smooth on my feet
My bitches the bad as can be
Stackin', then pray go to sleep
I'm at the top of the peak
Put baguettes on top of our teeth
Put fire in front of this beat
I can't lie, got shooters that creep
She from DeVry, she gon' suck me to sleep

Switch up the flow, they gon' bite it fosho
Put the stick on your bitch, get your hiding on low
This a 50, then young niggas ready to go
Richard Mille sit on my wrist, I'm the goat
Tag on your hoe, tag on your toe
Baguettes on baguettes, my neck overload
I'm having, you're capping, go rat to this pole
Take off his hat, leave a rat with a hole

Ain't no cap in me
The Trap be jumpin' like athletes
I get cash, you see
Lamborghini, niggas ain't as fast as me
Cookie' gas, the lean
I get the bag, casually
You niggas embarrassing
This Audemar, this is a masterpiece
