For My People
Joey Bada$$

Uh, now all heroes don't wear capes
And all villains don't get away
But all limits eventually fade
I don't wanna be good, nigga I'm tryin' to be great
It's hard when your back's against the wall
And if you got an order keep your feet up on the floor
That's why I thank the Lord when I wake up in the morn'
'Cause through him you can see every reason I was born
You can see the power when the mic is in my palm
When I storm across the room, hit the stage and perform
Word is bond, don't be alarmed
Don't let me have to sound a horn, and drop a bomb
Want to get my mom a crib, with a lawn
Something that my future kids, can run up on
That's why I always do my best to carry on
Heaven's like game of chess, don't be a pawn my nigga
