Grand Prix
Method Man

I'm a smoker, weed toker
The cola in your coka
Losing change up in your sofa
I brought change into the culture
Funny how these pigeons try and change into a vulture
You a poser, wit' pork all on your fork and that ain't kosher
No sir, I never put a penny in a loafer
For good times up in the ghetto, we had penny and Wilona 
You know I stretch a quarter, got a rock 'cause I'm a roller
And I'm bolder than a hard rock is 'cause I'm a stoner
I need closure, and you rappers need to wake up
And smell the begonias
You about to be goners
Big shot caller, I'm here to pop them corners
Little league ballers could get popped, I warned ya
Who put the person in persona, putting hands up on a person
Close the curtain on the Rama
Pack a Llama, catch me lurking I'm your karma
Sleeping on me even worse will get you murked in your pajamas
