Westside
The Game

Step off the porch, rag hangin', West Side, that's what we bangin'
Crucifix swingin' off my t-shirt, twistin' my fingers
Impala Off-White, ski mask all black
ADIDAS tracksuit, drawstrings, Chokin' the MAC
Got a couple bullets in it, gangstas slide in the rented
Dumpin' out the window, fuck the world and everything in it
I'm a West Side nigga, ego trippin' and walkin' fast
Listenin' so we talkin' in codes to keep 'em off us
Dre gon' tote it, thirty-six shots
Don Julio got me loaded, don't think I'm not
Go mob on niggas, mob figures, mob triggers
Don't get your punk ass killed on Instagram Live, nigga
My niggas rob niggas, bury you alive
Let the bullets live inside niggas, ain't nowhere to hide
It's survival of the fittest, boy, you fuckin' with the realest
Glock nine, blue steel, holster wrap the chinchilla
