In The Dark
Y G

I like my bitches dark
I hit 'em at the park when it's dark
I hit my target like a dart
Why Jee go dumb but he smart
In real life you a mark
Disrespect me, I'm on yo head I'm a scarf
Told my barber "Cut my hair, leave a part"
But don't line me up in the dark
My life dark but I see the truth 
Pop up on your bitch like peek-a-boo
I'm in the coupe, I don't need the roof
Her ass really shocked me like Pikachu
I do a bitch harsh
Break a heart to thousand parts
They like "How this ghetto nigga on the charts"
Face down, ass up, back gotta be arched
