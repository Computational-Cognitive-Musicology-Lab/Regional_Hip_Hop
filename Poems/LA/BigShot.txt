Big Shot
O.T. Genasis

Big watch, big chain, big strap
Beef, I'ma put you in a box, Big Mac
Big Ghost, got cream on the seat
Tryna figure who I'm gon' fuck this week
Coke man, move weight like Tony
Heard niggas trippin' so I'm bringing all the homies
Bands up, yeah, my pockets so thick
Cash and I got a good credit score bitch
Crack a nigga, where you from? Move summin
Dem niggas talk but they never do nothin'
Niggas hatin' 'cause they thought that I was done
Nah, platinum back to back, motherfucker I'm the one
